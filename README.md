# MNIST_Digit_Recognition

This project is a machine learning model that is trained to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model uses various algorithms such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression, and the results of these algorithms are compared to determine which one performs the best.

DEPENDACIES

The following libraries are used in this project:

pandas
numpy
seaborn
sklearn
matplotlib

DATA

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each of size 28 x 28 pixels. The dataset is divided into two parts: a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. The data is stored in the .csv format.

PREPROCCESSING

The images and labels are loaded into the program and separated into two variables each: images and labels. The images are then split into training and testing parts, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% used for testing. The data is then processed and analyzed using various algorithms.

ALGORITHMS

The following algorithms are used in this project:

RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Results
The results of the algorithms are displayed in the form of accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and precision, recall, and F1 scores. The results are then compared to determine which algorithm performs the best.

CONCLUSION

The project demonstrates the capability of machine learning algorithms in recognizing handwritten digits. The results show that the Random Forest Classifier is the best performing algorithm in this case, but other algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree can also be used for this purpose.
